		<p>
			Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed <a
				href="http://edcc.edu/marksheet/index.html">spatulas</a>! (What better way to say I love myself than to
			buy myself a spatula?)

		<!-- 
			JOURNAL ENTRY 2
			Following the same structure for consistency

		<h2>04/08/08: Cookie Monster Cupcakes</h2>
		<img src="images/cookiemonster.jpg" alt="Cookie Monster: in cupcake form!" />

		<p>
			My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes, so Cookie Monster
			cupcakes are the best of both worlds.
		</p>

		<p>
			Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, <q>Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what
				last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you.</q> I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes?
			(If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)
