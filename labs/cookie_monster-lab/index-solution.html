          Today was the best day ever! I got to meet Patrick, the most adorable 
          golden retriever puppy. He was so fluffy and playful. We spent the whole 
          afternoon at the dog park, and he even learned to fetch! I can't wait to 
          see him again next week. Life is good when you have furry friends.

          Later in the evening, I tried that new cafe downtown. The atmosphere was 
          perfect - cozy lighting, smooth jazz playing in the background, and the 
          best latte I've ever had. I brought my sketchbook and spent two hours 
          just drawing and people-watching. These are the moments I live for.

          Woke up early and drove to the coast. The weather was absolutely perfect - 
          not a cloud in the sky! I walked along the shore for hours, collecting 
          seashells and watching the waves crash against the rocks. Found a beautiful 
          piece of sea glass that I'm going to turn into a pendant.
        </p>
        
        <p class="journal-entry__content">
          The sunset was breathtaking. I sat on the beach with my camera and captured 
          some amazing photos. The sky turned brilliant shades of orange, pink, and 
          purple. Sometimes I forget how therapeutic nature can be. Definitely need 
          to make these beach trips a regular thing.

          Sometimes the best days are the ones where you do absolutely nothing 
          productive. Spent the entire day in my pajamas, reading that mystery 
          novel I've been putting off. Made myself hot chocolate with extra 
          marshmallows and just relaxed.

          In the afternoon, I FaceTimed with my college roommate. We laughed about 
          old memories and made plans to meet up next month. It's crazy how time 
          flies, but true friendships never fade. Feeling grateful for the simple 
          things today.

          Decided to challenge myself and make pasta from scratch. It was messier 
          than I expected! Flour everywhere, dough sticking to my hands, but the 
          end result was totally worth it. There's something satisfying about 
          creating food with your own hands.

        <p class="journal-entry__content">
          Had some friends over for dinner and they were all impressed. We had 
          such a great time - good food, good wine, and lots of laughter. These 
          are the memories I want to hold onto. Already planning next week's menu!
