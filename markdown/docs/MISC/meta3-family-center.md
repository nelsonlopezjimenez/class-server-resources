Unfortunately, **no** - adding more kids to that parent account's Family Center will **not** give them access to the purchased games.

## Why Family Center Doesn't Share Purchases:

**Family Center is only for supervision**, not game sharing:
- It lets you monitor and control your children's accounts
- It does NOT share purchased content between accounts
- Each Meta account's purchases stay locked to that specific account

Even if all 3 kids are supervised under the same parent account in Family Center, they still can't access games purchased on the parent's account from their own child accounts.

## Your Real Options for $160 in Games:

**Option 1: Shared Headset System (Best for preserving investment)**

All 3 kids share the Quest headset(s) that are logged into the parent accounts with purchases:

- **Quest 3** → logged into Parent Account 1 (Animal Company $33)
- **Quest 2 #1** → logged into Parent Account 2 ($160 in games) 
- **Quest 2 #2** → logged into one of the kid's accounts (for their own games)

The kids take turns using the headsets with purchased games. This preserves all $193 in purchases.

**Downsides:**
- Kids share headsets instead of each having their own
- Schedule conflicts
- Less convenient

**Option 2: Keep Current Setup (Simplest)**

Just accept the situation as-is:
- Parent Account 1 → supervises 2 kids
- Parent Account 2 → supervises 1 kid (who has access to $160 in games)
- Each parent account manages its respective kids

The kid supervised by Parent Account 2 gets lucky and has access to more games. Not perfectly "fair" but preserves everything.

**Option 3: Meta's App Sharing (Check Availability)**

Meta is rolling out App Sharing for some users:

1. Put on the Quest headset with Parent Account 2
2. Go to **Settings → Accounts → App Sharing** (if available)
3. Enable sharing with specific accounts

This feature lets you share purchased apps with other accounts on the same headset. **This is exactly what you need**, but it's not available to everyone yet.

**To check:** Look in Settings on the headset logged into Parent Account 2.

## Option 4: Accept Partial Loss

Move all 3 kids to Parent Account 1 supervision, and:
- Keep the $160 account logged into one Quest 2 as a "family gaming headset"
- Kids use their own accounts on other headsets
- When they want to play the $160 worth of games, they use that specific shared headset

## My Recommendation:

**Check for App Sharing first** (Option 3) - if it's available, that's your solution.

**If not available**, go with **Option 2** (keep current setup) because:
- Zero loss of purchases
- Minimal complexity
- Yes, you manage 2 Family Centers, but that's a small price to pay to preserve $193

**Does the headset with Parent Account 2 have the App Sharing option available?** That's the first thing to check.
