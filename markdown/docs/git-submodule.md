When you push a repository with submodules to GitHub, the submodules need to be handled separately. Here's what you need to do:

## Understanding Submodules

Submodules are independent Git repositories. When you pushed your main repository, Git only pushed a **reference** to the submodule (specifically, which commit the submodule should point to), not the actual submodule content.

## Steps to Push Submodules

**Yes, you need to create separate repositories for each submodule.** Here's the process:

1. **Create a new GitHub repository for the submodule** (one for each submodule you have)

2. **Navigate to the submodule directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/submodule
   ```

3. **Add the remote and push**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/submodule-repo.git
   git push -u origin main  # or master, depending on your branch name
   ```

4. **Return to your main repository**:
   ```bash
   cd ../..  # back to main repo root
   ```

5. **Verify the submodule configuration**:
   Check your `.gitmodules` file to ensure it points to the correct GitHub URL:
   ```
   [submodule "path/to/submodule"]
       path = path/to/submodule
       url = https://github.com/yourusername/submodule-repo.git
   ```

6. **If you updated the URL**, commit the change:
   ```bash
   git add .gitmodules
   git commit -m "Update submodule URL"
   git push
   ```

## Quick Check

When someone clones your main repository, they'll need to run:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourusername/main-repo.git
```

Or if already cloned:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This confirms everything is set up correctly!

You can definitely add a second URL to your submodule configuration! However, Git's `.gitmodules` file doesn't natively support multiple URLs for a single submodule. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Use Multiple Remotes (Recommended)

Navigate to your submodule and add a second remote:

```bash
cd path/to/submodule
git remote add gitea https://your-gitea-instance.com/username/submodule-repo.git
git remote -v  # verify both remotes exist
```

Now you can push to both:
```bash
git push origin main      # pushes to GitHub
git push gitea main       # pushes to Gitea
```

Your `.gitmodules` file stays simple with just one URL (typically the "primary" one):
```
[submodule "path/to/submodule"]
    path = path/to/submodule
    url = https://github.com/yourusername/submodule-repo.git
```

## Option 2: Configure Push URLs

You can configure a remote to push to multiple locations:

```bash
cd path/to/submodule
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://github.com/yourusername/submodule-repo.git
git remote set-url --add --push origin https://your-gitea-instance.com/username/submodule-repo.git
```

Now `git push origin main` will push to both URLs simultaneously.

## Option 3: Script It

Create a simple script to push to multiple locations:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd path/to/submodule
git push origin main
git push gitea main
cd ../..
```

## For the Main Repository

Do the same for your main repository - add Gitea as a second remote and push to both locations as needed.

Which approach would work best for your workflow?

You're in a **detached HEAD state** in your submodule. This happens because the parent repository points to a specific commit (4d0ae6f) rather than a branch. This is actually normal for submodules, but you need to fix it before making changes.

## Here's how to proceed:

### Option 1: Attach to the main branch (Recommended)

```bash
# You're already in the submodule directory
git checkout main
```

This will move you from the detached HEAD to the `main` branch.

### Option 2: If you want the parent to track the main branch

After checking out main, go back to your parent repository and update the submodule reference:

```bash
cd ../..  # back to parent repo
git add go-class-server-Frontend
git commit -m "Update submodule to track main branch"
git push
```

## Understanding What Happened

When you have submodules, the parent repository stores a specific commit hash (4d0ae6f in your case), not a branch name. When someone clones or updates submodules, Git checks out that exact commit, resulting in a detached HEAD.

## Going Forward

**Before making changes in your submodule:**
1. Always `git checkout main` (or your working branch)
2. Make your changes
3. Commit and push in the submodule
4. Go to parent repo and update the submodule reference

**Quick verification:**
```bash
git checkout main
git branch  # should show * main now
```

Are you planning to make changes to this submodule, or just push the existing code?
