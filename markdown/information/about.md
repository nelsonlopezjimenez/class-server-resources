## About the instructor  
#### *Dr Lopez*  
I'm a scientist and educator with a passion for bridging the worlds of biology and technology. With a PhD in genetics and background in computational methods, I enjoy exploring how data and algorithms can unlock biological mysteries.

When I'm not teaching programming languages or web development, you'll find me jogging to clear my head, discovering new sci-fi series, or sharing the wonders of science with my family. I believe the best discoveries happen when curiosity meets collaboration.

Currently teaching MERN stack development and always learning something new myself.

### About the CAs  

#### John Brooks
Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS (Though I loath it), PHP, SQL,    
Interests:  Gaming, Seahawks, Mariners, D&D (and other TRPG's), MtG. 

Brooks is a coder who spends approximately 80% of his time meticulously debugging reality, and the remaining 20% obsessively perfecting his high score in what ever game he is currently playing.
His brain runs on a potent combination of sugar, JavaScript, React, and the sporadic thrill of an NFL victory. 
He's been known to translate UML diagrams into surprisingly effective battle strategies, and He is currently accepting applications for someone to remind him where he put his id. 
Let's be honest, He also dedicate a frankly alarming amount of time consulting with Gemma - because, frankly, she seems to have all the answers.
He's fairly certain she's plotting world domination… one well-structured algorithm at a time.

#### Jim Burns
Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Powershell    
Interests: Web development, Motorcycles, Travel, Photography, Video Games, Roman Catholicism... not in that order.  

Burns was raised in a military family and spent over eight years in the US Army as a helicopter mechanic, then a helicopter inspector. 
Upon leaving, He earned an Associates in Technical Arts - Computer Science degree at Skagit Valley Community College. He worked in multiple IT related jobs afterward before landing his dream job at Microsoft. 
His first job was a IT Manager with the Bing Test team, then moving on to the 1 vs 100 game team at Xbox Live as A Program Manager. 
His final job was with the Xbox hardware team as an Operations Program Manger.

Burns has traveled extensively in the U.S. as well as overseas (Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Japan and Korea). 
He loves to experiencing the history, cultures (the people and their foods) as well as the unique sites. 
Upon release, his dream is to continue traveling by motorcycle across the US and Europe and writing or blogging about those experiences.

#### Rocky Connor
Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Python, Perl  
Interests: Computer Science, Electronic Engineering, Sustainablility.

Growing up, Connor has always been facinatied by technology and computers.
he was always getting in trouble tearing apart anything he could get his hands on.
Old VCRs, cassette decks, toys, engines, it didn't matter. The drive to figure out
how things worked was strong. After being sent to prison, the new found constraints
did nothing to staunch his inquisitive nature. After taking the Web Dev certificate 
program at MCC/TRU, he has continued to teach himself programming languages and
other more advanced topics.

#### Jay Gray

His 5-year plan is to get an Engineering Master's in machine learning, and become an AI researcher.
While working as a Classroom Assistant for Grays Harbor College, he co-wrote a Python/Pandas/Psycho/PostgreSQL application to track laptops, books, and classroom materials for 200 students.
